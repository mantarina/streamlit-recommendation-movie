Fictional project done in Wild Code School.

With IMDb database, after major data merging, processing and cleaning, we designed a recommandation algorithm based on genre, votes, number of votes and a selection of movie directors.

For this project, we used:

Pandas
Matplotlib and Seaborn for some visualisation
Scikit Learn and KNN algorithm for Machine Learning
Sreamlit for presentation
You can see the the recommandation system here : https://share.streamlit.io/mantarina/streamlit-recommendation-movie/main/streamlit-recommendation-movie.py
